# Framework Requirements

## Purpose

The framework is designed to demonstrate enterprise-level Quality Engineering practices using Playwright and TypeScript against a production-like web application.

The framework should be scalable, maintainable, CI-friendly, and suitable for UI, API, accessibility, visual, and performance testing.

## Functional Requirements

The framework must support:

- UI end-to-end testing
- API testing
- Authentication and session reuse
- Multiple user roles
- Cross-browser execution
- Parallel execution
- Test retries
- Test tagging and filtering
- Environment-specific configuration
- Test data management
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recording when required
- Playwright traces
- HTML and machine-readable reporting
- CI/CD execution
- Docker-based execution
- Accessibility testing
- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing
- API and UI test composition
- Mocking and network interception
- Secrets management
- Multiple deployment environments

## Non-Functional Requirements

The framework should be:

### Maintainable

Tests should be easy to understand, modify, and debug.

### Scalable

The architecture should remain manageable as the test suite grows to hundreds or thousands of tests.

### Reliable

The framework should minimize flaky tests and provide useful diagnostic information when failures occur.

### Fast

Tests should support parallel execution, efficient authentication, and appropriate separation between UI and API coverage.

### Reusable

Common functionality should be implemented once and reused through fixtures, helpers, domain abstractions, and shared utilities.

### CI-Friendly

The framework must run consistently in local environments, CI pipelines, and containers.

### Observable

Failures should provide sufficient logs, screenshots, traces, videos, and reports for efficient troubleshooting.

### Secure

Credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information must never be committed to source control.

### Extensible

New testing capabilities should be addable without requiring major redesign of the framework.

## Target Test Application

The framework currently targets UPEX DOJO, a production-like web application used to demonstrate enterprise Quality Engineering practices across UI and API layers.

Application:

- Live application: `https://dojo.upexgalaxy.com`
- API documentation: `https://dojo.upexgalaxy.com/api/docs`
- Source repository: `upex-galaxy/upex-dojo`

The application provides realistic workflows including:

- user registration;
- authentication;
- authenticated user sessions;
- task management;
- task CRUD operations;
- REST API access;
- token-based API authentication;
- browser session authentication;
- API and UI workflow composition;
- network interception and mocking.

The application intentionally supports two authentication contexts used by the framework:

- REST API authentication through Bearer JWT tokens;
- browser authentication through an Auth.js session.

This distinction allows the framework to demonstrate realistic API setup, programmatic browser authentication, authenticated UI testing, and API/UI composition without relying on slow UI-based setup.

## Out of Scope for Initial Version

The first version will not attempt to provide:

- full mobile native testing
- exhaustive security penetration testing
- large-scale production load testing
- infrastructure testing
- full Kubernetes orchestration

These areas may be introduced later if they provide clear portfolio or market value.

## Success Criteria

The framework will be considered successful when:

- tests can run locally and in CI;
- UI and API layers are both covered;
- test architecture is clearly documented;
- failures are easy to diagnose;
- tests can execute in parallel;
- environments and secrets are handled cleanly;
- Docker execution is supported;
- accessibility and visual checks are integrated;
- the repository can be confidently presented during a Senior QA / SDET interview.
