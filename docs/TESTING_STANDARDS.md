# Testing Standards

## Purpose

This document defines the implementation standards for creating, modifying, placing, and executing tests in the Playwright Enterprise Framework.

`ARCHITECTURE.md` defines where responsibilities belong and why. This document defines how those architectural rules are applied during implementation.

These standards apply to both human contributors and AI-assisted development.

## Core Rule

Before writing code, inspect the existing implementation and determine which framework layers and execution boundaries are actually required.

Do not create a new abstraction merely because a new test is being added.

Prefer:

```text
reuse
→ extend
→ create
```

in that order.

Equivalent responsibilities should follow existing golden patterns.

Different responsibilities should not be forced into artificial structural uniformity.

## New Test Implementation Workflow

When implementing a new test, follow this sequence:

```text
Understand the behavior
        ↓
Find an analogous existing test
        ↓
Identify required framework layers
        ↓
Identify required execution project
        ↓
Reuse existing layers where possible
        ↓
Extend existing layers where appropriate
        ↓
Create missing layers only when required
        ↓
Implement the spec
        ↓
Format
        ↓
Typecheck
        ↓
Run affected project
        ↓
Review architecture impact
```

Before implementation, answer:

1. What behavior is being verified?
2. Is this primarily API, UI, or composed API/UI behavior?
3. Is the behavior browser-independent or browser-dependent?
4. Which Playwright project should own the test?
5. Is there an existing test demonstrating a similar pattern?
6. Which existing framework components can be reused?
7. Which components genuinely need modification?
8. Is any new abstraction actually required?

## Test Placement and Project Selection

Test location communicates execution responsibility.

Current ownership:

```text
tests/api/**
→ api project

tests/ui/**
→ chromium
→ firefox
→ webkit

tests/smoke/**
→ chromium
→ firefox
→ webkit
```

API tests are browser-independent and must execute through the dedicated `api` project.

UI and smoke tests are browser-dependent and execute through browser projects.

Do not allow API tests to run once per browser simply because browser projects exist.

Do not use browser projects for HTTP-only contract validation.

When adding a new API test:

```text
place under tests/api
→ execute with --project=api
```

When adding a new UI or smoke test:

```text
place under tests/ui or tests/smoke
→ execute through the intended browser project
```

If the test behavior does not fit an existing execution boundary, review the architecture before introducing a new project.

## Layer Decision Guide

Use this guide when deciding what must change.

```text
Need to call a new API endpoint?
→ API Client

Need to define or change a provider request/response contract?
→ Schema

Need reusable stable domain values?
→ Constants

Need generated or reusable test data?
→ Factory

Need reusable setup, state, dependency composition, or lifecycle?
→ Fixture

Need page-level UI interaction?
→ Page Object

Need reusable UI-region interaction?
→ Component Object

Need controlled network behavior?
→ Mock

Need to verify behavior?
→ Spec
```

Not every test requires every layer.

A new test should modify the smallest set of layers necessary to represent the behavior correctly.

## Existing Implementation First

Before creating a new file or abstraction:

1. search for an existing implementation with the same responsibility;
2. inspect at least one analogous implementation;
3. determine whether the existing component can be extended;
4. preserve the established structural pattern where the responsibility is equivalent;
5. inspect the execution project used by the analogous test.

For example:

```text
New user API behavior
→ inspect UserApiClient
→ inspect user schemas
→ inspect userFactory
→ inspect relevant fixtures
→ inspect existing user API specs
→ keep execution in the api project
```

or:

```text
New task UI behavior
→ inspect TasksDashboardPage
→ inspect relevant components
→ inspect taskFactory
→ inspect authenticated fixtures
→ inspect existing task UI specs
→ keep execution in browser projects
```

Existing implementations are reference patterns, not templates to copy blindly.

## API Test Standard

A successful API test should normally follow:

```text
prerequisite / test data

request + HTTP assertion

parse response
runtime schema validation

business assertions
```

Example structure:

```ts
test("creates a task", async ({ taskApi, authenticatedTestUser }) => {
  const request = createTask();

  const response = await taskApi.createTask(
    request,
    authenticatedTestUser.accessToken,
  );
  expect(response.status()).toBe(201);

  const body = await response.json();
  validateSchema(taskResponseSchema, body);

  expect(body.title).toBe(request.title);
  expect(body.priority).toBe(request.priority);
});
```

Runtime validation must happen before successful provider data is trusted as a typed contract.

Do not use a TypeScript cast to bypass runtime validation.

Avoid:

```ts
const body = (await response.json()) as TaskResponse;
```

Prefer:

```ts
const body = await response.json();
validateSchema(taskResponseSchema, body);
```

After validation, TypeScript may safely use the schema-derived type.

API tests belong to the dedicated `api` project and should not depend on browser installation or browser-engine execution.

## Negative API Test Standard

Negative tests should normally follow:

```text
prerequisite / test data

request + HTTP assertion

parse response

error/business assertions
```

Do not validate an error response against a successful response schema.

Do not introduce a generic error schema merely for structural symmetry.

Use a reusable error schema only when the provider exposes a stable, meaningful error contract that benefits from runtime validation.

Negative API tests remain browser-independent unless browser behavior itself is part of the scenario.

## API Client Standard

Before adding a client method:

- confirm the responsibility belongs to that domain client;
- follow the existing request construction pattern;
- preserve raw response access when tests need status or negative-response control;
- avoid assertions inside client methods.

Setup helpers may provide stronger guarantees when repeated successful setup is their explicit responsibility.

Do not introduce a generic base client unless demonstrated duplication justifies it.

## Schema Standard

Provider API contracts use TypeBox as the source of truth.

Use:

```ts
export const exampleSchema = Type.Object({
  id: Type.String(),
});

export type Example = Static<typeof exampleSchema>;
```

Do not maintain a separate TypeScript interface that duplicates the same provider contract.

Schema definitions must reflect observed provider behavior, including:

- required fields;
- optional fields;
- nullable values;
- formats;
- enums;
- server-generated defaults.

## Constants Standard

Extract a constant when the value represents reusable and stable domain knowledge.

Do not extract values merely to avoid string literals.

Prefer local values for scenario-specific or one-off test inputs.

Domain unions should derive from canonical constant arrays when appropriate.

## Factory Standard

Factories should generate valid test data by default.

Preferred pattern:

```text
valid defaults
+
explicit overrides
=
scenario-specific data
```

Factories may additionally support intentionally partial or invalid data when negative testing requires it.

Factories must not:

- call APIs;
- interact with UI;
- perform assertions;
- manage test lifecycle.

Before creating a new factory, determine whether the existing domain factory can be extended cleanly.

## Fixture Standard

Create or extend a fixture when the behavior provides meaningful:

- reusable setup;
- state;
- dependency composition;
- lifecycle management.

Do not create a fixture solely to hide trivial construction.

Fixture ordering should communicate logical dependency flow rather than alphabetical ordering.

When adding a fixture:

1. identify its dependencies;
2. reuse existing lower-level fixtures;
3. keep its responsibility focused;
4. clean up owned resources when required;
5. preserve authentication boundaries.

## Authentication Standard

Do not treat API authentication and browser authentication as interchangeable.

```text
API
→ Bearer JWT

Browser
→ Auth.js session
```

Use the fixture matching the required state:

```text
testUserData
→ generated only

registeredTestUser
→ registered

authenticatedTestUser
→ registered + API authenticated

authenticatedPage
→ browser-authenticated Page
```

Do not replace programmatic browser authentication with UI login merely for convenience.

UI login should be performed when login behavior itself is under test.

Objects interacting with `authenticatedPage` must be constructed from that Page or from a fixture that explicitly depends on it.

## Page Object Standard

Page Objects should follow this structural grammar:

```text
external imports

internal imports

class
  page
  locators

  constructor
    page assignment
    locator assignments

  navigation methods

  user action methods

  locator query/helper methods
```

Only include sections that the Page Object actually needs.

Prefer meaningful domain actions over exposing low-level interaction sequences to specs.

Example:

```ts
await loginPage.login(email, password);
```

rather than:

```ts
await loginPage.emailInput.fill(email);
await loginPage.passwordInput.fill(password);
await loginPage.loginButton.click();
```

when the behavior being tested is not the individual field interaction.

Assertions normally remain in specs.

## Component Object Standard

Use a Component Object for a reusable UI region that does not represent an entire page.

Scope child locators to the component root when the real DOM hierarchy supports it.

Do not force root scoping when the application renders an element outside the component subtree.

Portal-rendered dropdowns, dialogs, menus, and similar UI may require page-scoped locators.

DOM reality takes precedence over visual or structural symmetry.

## UI Spec Standard

UI tests should normally follow:

```text
prerequisite / setup

action

primary assertion
related assertions
```

Related assertions should remain visually grouped.

Do not insert blank lines between every assertion.

Do not add generic comments such as:

```ts
// Arrange
// Act
// Assert
```

The test structure should communicate these phases without commentary.

Comments should explain non-obvious reasons rather than restating code.

UI and smoke tests must remain compatible with the browser projects that own them.

Do not introduce browser-specific behavior into a shared test unless the difference is intentional and documented.

## API/UI Composition

Prefer API or programmatic setup when UI setup would make a test slower, more brittle, or unrelated to the behavior under test.

For example:

```text
register through API
→ establish browser session programmatically
→ verify authenticated UI behavior
```

Do not use UI flows merely because the final assertion is a UI assertion.

The setup mechanism should serve the behavior being tested.

An API-assisted UI test remains a browser-dependent UI test when the observable behavior under validation is UI behavior.

Its execution ownership therefore remains with the browser projects rather than the API project.

## Mock Standard

Before creating a mock:

1. determine the exact network behavior that must be controlled;
2. intercept only the required request;
3. preserve unrelated traffic;
4. reproduce realistic provider behavior;
5. keep assertions in the spec.

Do not create a generic mock abstraction before repeated mocking behavior demonstrates a need.

A mocked UI test remains browser-dependent if it verifies UI behavior.

## Docker Execution Standard

Docker execution must preserve the same Playwright project ownership and framework behavior as native execution.

Docker changes the execution environment, not the responsibility of the test.

```text
native execution
or
Docker execution
        ↓
same Playwright projects
        ↓
same test ownership
        ↓
same framework behavior
```

### Image Standard

Use the official Playwright image matching the Playwright version installed by the project lockfile.

The current image is:

```text
mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.62.1-noble
```

Do not use an arbitrary `latest` Playwright image.

Browser binaries and operating-system dependencies are provided by the official Playwright image, so the Dockerfile should not reinstall Playwright browsers without a demonstrated need.

Install project dependencies reproducibly with:

```text
npm ci
```

Copy package metadata before the remaining source so dependency installation can use Docker layer caching when dependency metadata has not changed.

### Runtime Configuration Standard

Environment-specific test configuration must be supplied at container runtime rather than baked into the image.

Prefer:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e TEST_ENV=hosted \
  playwright-enterprise-tests
```

Do not encode the selected `TEST_ENV` into the Docker image.

The framework follows:

```text
build once
→ configure at runtime
```

Container execution environment and test target environment are separate concerns.

### Project Execution Standard

Use one reusable test image across the existing Playwright projects.

To execute a specific project, override the default container command:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e TEST_ENV=hosted \
  playwright-enterprise-tests \
  npx playwright test --project=api
```

Do not create separate Docker images for API, Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit merely because they are separate Playwright projects.

Project selection remains a Playwright execution concern.

### Container Lifecycle Standard

Automated test containers should normally be ephemeral.

Use:

```text
--rm
```

when the stopped container itself is not required for post-execution debugging.

The Playwright process is the main container process. Its exit code represents the execution result:

```text
0
→ successful execution

non-zero
→ failed execution
```

Do not treat a successfully started container as evidence that the test execution succeeded.

### Artifact Persistence Standard

Do not rely on an ephemeral container filesystem for artifacts that must survive execution.

For local Docker execution, persist Playwright outputs through bind mounts when the generated reports or diagnostics are required after container removal.

Example:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e TEST_ENV=hosted \
  -v "$(pwd)/playwright-report:/app/playwright-report" \
  -v "$(pwd)/test-results:/app/test-results" \
  playwright-enterprise-tests
```

This preserves:

```text
playwright-report/
test-results/
```

outside the container lifecycle.

Do not assume that local Docker bind mounts and CI artifact upload are the same mechanism.

```text
local Docker
→ bind mount

GitHub Actions
→ artifact upload
```

Use the persistence mechanism appropriate to the execution environment.

### Build Context and Secret Standard

The Docker build context must exclude local files that do not belong in the reusable image.

`.dockerignore` should exclude generated outputs, local dependencies, Git metadata, and environment files where applicable.

Current examples include:

```text
node_modules
playwright-report
test-results
.git
.env
.env.*
```

Secrets must not be copied into the Docker image.

Do not:

```text
COPY secret
→ use secret
→ delete secret
```

and assume the secret has been removed safely.

Data introduced into an earlier image layer may remain recoverable from the image history.

Runtime credentials, when genuinely required, must be supplied through an appropriate runtime secret mechanism rather than embedded into the image.

### Docker and CI Standard

The current GitHub Actions pipeline uses Docker as the Playwright test execution environment.

CI must preserve the same execution principles used by local Docker execution:

```text
one reusable image
→ runtime configuration
→ Playwright project selection
→ ephemeral container execution
→ durable external artifacts
```

The test image must be built once per workflow execution and reused across API and browser jobs.

Do not independently rebuild an equivalent image in every test job unless a demonstrated isolation or performance requirement justifies it.

The current CI image flow is:

```text
quality
→ build image once
→ tag with github.sha
→ docker save
→ temporary workflow artifact
→ download in test job
→ docker load
→ docker run
```

API and UI jobs must use the same built image.

Playwright remains responsible for selecting the execution project:

```text
API job
→ --project=api

UI matrix
→ --project=chromium
→ --project=firefox
→ --project=webkit
```

Docker must not introduce separate images merely to mirror Playwright project boundaries.

Containerized CI execution should remain ephemeral through `--rm`.

Reports and diagnostics that must survive the container lifecycle must be mounted to the GitHub Actions runner and then preserved using the existing CI artifact strategy.

When evolving the containerized CI model, evaluate:

- reproducibility;
- image build and transfer cost;
- execution time;
- artifact size;
- debugging experience;
- runner storage;
- maintenance overhead.

Docker should remain in CI because it currently provides an intentional shared execution boundary, not merely for architectural symmetry.

## CI Execution Standard

The current CI dependency model is:

```text
quality
    ↓
build-image
    ↓
    ├── api
    └── ui matrix
        ├── chromium
        ├── firefox
        └── webkit
```

The `build-image` job should depend on successful quality validation.

The `api` and `ui` jobs should depend on the successfully built image rather than directly on the quality job.

API and UI jobs must remain independent from one another unless a genuine runtime dependency is introduced.

Do not serialize independent jobs merely because they belong to the same workflow.

The quality job should fail fast on inexpensive validation before expensive image building and browser execution begins.

Current quality gates include:

```text
Prettier
→ TypeScript typecheck
```

## CI Hardening Standard

CI optimization must not weaken reproducibility or diagnostic quality.

The quality job may use the npm package cache to reduce repeated dependency download cost while preserving:

```text
npm ci
```

as its reproducible dependency installation command.

The Docker image must also install project dependencies reproducibly through `npm ci`.

Containerized test jobs should reuse the dependency state already contained in the built image rather than reinstalling dependencies independently.

Do not replace reproducible installation with a cached `node_modules` directory merely to reduce execution time.

Workflow concurrency should cancel obsolete executions belonging to the same logical pull request or branch while keeping unrelated changes isolated.

```text
same logical change
→ newer run may cancel older run

different pull requests
→ independent execution
```

CI jobs must define reasonable job-level timeout ceilings.

Current limits:

```text
quality
→ 5 minutes

build-image
→ 15 minutes

api
→ 10 minutes

ui
→ 10 minutes per browser matrix job
```

Timeout ceilings protect runner resources from stuck execution. They must not be increased merely to hide unexplained performance degradation or flaky behavior.

Browser matrix execution uses:

```text
fail-fast: false
```

A failure in one browser should not cancel the remaining browser jobs because the complete matrix provides browser-specific diagnostic information.

Retries are a resilience and diagnostic mechanism, not a flaky-test solution.

```text
first attempt passes
→ healthy signal

first attempt fails
→ retry passes
→ potential flakiness
→ investigate
```

A test that repeatedly requires retries must not be treated as equivalent to a consistently passing test.

Flaky tests should be investigated and corrected. If temporary quarantine becomes necessary, it should have an explicit reason, ownership, and path back to normal execution rather than becoming permanent ignored coverage.

## CI Browser Installation Standard

Containerized Playwright test jobs must use the browser runtime already provided by the reusable Playwright Docker image.

API job:

```text
load reusable test image
→ no browser execution required
→ execute --project=api
```

UI matrix job:

```text
load same reusable test image
→ select matrix browser through Playwright project
→ execute matching project
```

Do not reinstall Playwright browsers independently in API or UI test jobs when the required browser binaries and operating-system dependencies are already provided by the shared image.

Do not create browser-specific Docker images merely to match the browser matrix.

## CI Environment Standard

CI execution must explicitly select the intended test target.

Current CI target:

```text
TEST_ENV=hosted
```

Do not rely on an implicit default environment for CI behavior when the intended target can be stated explicitly.

The GitHub Actions `CI` environment variable and framework `TEST_ENV` variable represent different concerns:

```text
CI
→ execution context

TEST_ENV
→ test target
```

Do not treat them as interchangeable.

## CI Permission and Secret Standard

Use least privilege for workflow permissions.

A test workflow should not receive write access unless a concrete workflow requirement needs it.

Sensitive values must not be hardcoded in workflow YAML.

Do not introduce placeholder or demonstration secrets when the framework has no real secret requirement.

When secrets are required:

- store them in the appropriate secret store;
- expose them only to trusted execution contexts;
- do not log their values;
- do not provide trusted secrets to untrusted PR code.

## CI Artifact Standard

Use artifacts to preserve human-readable test reports and failure diagnostics.

Preferred strategy:

```text
HTML report
→ always upload

Failure diagnostics
→ upload on failure
```

Artifact names must identify their execution scope.

Examples:

```text
playwright-report-api
playwright-report-chromium
playwright-report-firefox
playwright-report-webkit

test-results-api
test-results-chromium
test-results-firefox
test-results-webkit
```

The artifact name and artifact path are separate concepts.

For example:

```text
artifact name
→ playwright-report-firefox

local path
→ playwright-report/
```

Matrix jobs may use the same local path because they execute on isolated runners.

Do not duplicate the same report into multiple artifacts unless there is a demonstrated diagnostic need.

Retention should be finite and intentional.

## Matrix Standard

Use a GitHub Actions matrix when the same CI responsibility should execute independently against multiple parameter values.

Current browser matrix:

```text
chromium
firefox
webkit
```

Matrix execution provides:

- parallel browser execution;
- browser-specific failure signals;
- browser-specific artifacts;
- independent job isolation.

A matrix is not the same as a Playwright project.

```text
Playwright project
→ test configuration and ownership

GitHub Actions matrix
→ CI job replication and parameterization
```

Do not introduce a matrix when a single execution would provide equivalent coverage.

## Sharding Standard

Sharding divides a sufficiently large test suite into multiple execution partitions.

Sharding should be introduced when runtime and test volume demonstrate a real need.

Do not add sharding merely because the tooling supports it.

Sharding does not determine which test category should execute once versus once per browser.

Use project boundaries for execution responsibility.

Use sharding for distributing test volume.

## Naming and Structure

Names should communicate domain responsibility.

Prefer:

```text
UserApiClient
TaskApiClient
TasksDashboardPage
createTestUser
createTask
authenticatedPage
```

Avoid generic names that hide responsibility.

Same-role files should follow the same structural grammar where practical.

Do not make different roles artificially identical.

## Imports and Formatting

Separate external and internal imports:

```ts
import { test } from "@playwright/test";

import { UserApiClient } from "../api/clients/UserApiClient";
```

Do not add blank lines between arbitrary internal import subgroups unless a meaningful convention requires them.

Use Prettier as the formatting authority.

Prettier does not decide semantic whitespace. Contributors remain responsible for removing unnecessary blank lines.

CI must run Prettier in check mode rather than silently rewriting repository files.

## Comments

Comments should explain why something non-obvious exists.

Good:

```ts
// Dropdown content is portal-rendered outside the navigation subtree.
```

Avoid:

```ts
// Click button
await button.click();
```

Avoid generic AAA comments when the structure is already clear.

## Creating New Abstractions

Before creating a new:

- client;
- schema;
- constant collection;
- factory;
- fixture;
- Page Object;
- Component Object;
- mock;
- utility;
- Playwright project;
- CI job;
- CI matrix dimension;

ask:

```text
Does this responsibility already exist?
        ↓
yes → reuse it

Can the existing abstraction own this responsibility cleanly?
        ↓
yes → extend it

Is this genuinely a new responsibility?
        ↓
yes → create the smallest appropriate abstraction
```

Do not design for hypothetical future requirements.

Repeated real usage should drive generalization.

## Definition of Done

Before considering a test implementation complete:

```text
Behavior implemented
        ↓
Correct test suite selected
        ↓
Correct Playwright project owns the test
        ↓
Architecture boundaries respected
        ↓
Existing abstractions reused where appropriate
        ↓
No unnecessary abstraction introduced
        ↓
Prettier passes
        ↓
TypeScript typecheck passes
        ↓
Affected tests pass
        ↓
Relevant project/regression scope passes when appropriate
        ↓
CI execution remains valid when shared execution config changes
        ↓
Documentation updated if architecture or standards changed
```

A passing test is necessary but not sufficient.

The implementation should also preserve the maintainability, execution efficiency, and architectural consistency of the framework.

## AI-Assisted Development

AI-generated code is held to the same standard as human-written code.

An AI agent must not assume that generating the spec file alone completes a testing task.

A request such as:

```text
Add tests for a new task feature
```

may legitimately require changes to:

```text
schema
→ client
→ constants
→ factory
→ fixture
→ Page Object / Component
→ mock
→ spec
→ execution configuration
```

but only the layers required by the behavior should be modified.

Agents should inspect existing implementations and project ownership before deciding which layers are required.

When generating a new test, an agent must determine whether the behavior belongs to:

```text
api project
```

or:

```text
browser projects
```

before implementation.

Agents must not cause browser-independent API tests to execute redundantly across browser projects.

Architecture must drive generated code, not the other way around.
